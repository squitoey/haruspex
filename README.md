# Haruspex

The Latin terms haruspex and haruspicina are from an archaic word, haru = "entrails, intestines" (cognate with hernia
= "protruding viscera" and hira = "empty gut"; PIE *ǵʰer-) and from the root spec- = "to watch, observe". The Greek
ἡπατοσκοπία hēpatoskōpia is from hēpar = "liver" and skop- = "to examine".

API Haruspex is a tool used to watch, observe, or examine the entrails and intestines of a REST API service.
